<h1>TOMODACHI Disability Leadership Training Program in America</h1>

<h2>OUR LEADERSHIP PROGRAM</h2>

<p>Our intensive five-month disability leadership and advocacy training takes place in Boston, Massachusetts. The goal of the program is to train the next generation of young Japanese people with disabilities to become stronger and more confident leaders.</p>

<p>Through this program, trainees not only enhance their leadership and advocacy skills but also gain new knowledge and expertise related to disability and inclusion. Trainees also improve their English language or American Sign Language proficiency.</p>

<p>The program uses a group model to further trainees’ leadership and advocacy training skills. However, trainees also pursue their own independent projects inspired by a question, issue, or program related to disability. As part of their projects, trainees participate in an internship with a disability-focused government or community organization.</p>

<p>After graduating from the program, trainees contribute to communities in disability leadership roles. They also become mentors to future program participants. The program is part of the <a href="http://www.usjapantomodachi.org/">TOMODACHI Initiative</a>, a public-private partnership between the <a href="http://www.usjapancouncil.org/">U.S.-Japan Council</a> and the <a href="http://japan.usembassy.gov/">U.S. Embassy in Tokyo</a>. The program is supported by Northrop Grumman Corporation, and implemented by the Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) at UMass Boston, through partnership with TOMODACHI. Since the 1960s, the ICI has been a leader in disability inclusion and advocacy.</p>

<h3>MAIN PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS</h3>

<h2>MEET OUR 2016 TOMODACHI TRAINEES</h2>

<h2>Ms. Yui Awai</h2>

<blockquote><p>I believe that college is a very important transition period for entering into mainstream >society. Students with disabilities should be able to choose their college and their field >of study while living independently away from their families.”</p></blockquote>

<p>space</p>

<blockquote><p>Japanese students with disabilities tend to be rather passive
– not advocating for their needs at the office of disability student services. I’d like to change this as a person with a disability.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Yui Awai is a forth-year student in the Department of Culture, Media, and Society at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan.</p>

<p>Born with cerebral palsy, Yui attended regular schools in Kagawa Prefecture on Shikoku Island in the south of Japan until she moved to Tokyo. When preparing for university, Yui applied to the local government for a subsidy for an electric wheelchair that would allow her to live more independently. However, her request was rejected. The local officials recommended that she attend a university in her hometown so that she could live with her parents.</p>

<p>Yui advocated for herself, telling the local government representatives that an electric wheelchair was vital for her to get around campus and to be able to live independently. In the end, she succeeded in advocating for her needs and received the funds for an electric wheelchair.</p>

<p>In addition to her studies at Waseda University, Yui is also involved with the DO-IT Japan Program at Tokyo University. Modeled after the DO-IT Program at the University of Washington in the United States (http://www.washington.edu/doit/), the program supports individuals with disabilities in accessing higher education and trains them in disability leadership and advocacy.</p>

<p>Yui is currently interning with the DO-IT Japan Program. Through this internship, she has learned how to accept her disability, how to advocate for her needs, and how to be more self-determined. Yui is also involved with the office of disability services at Waseda University, which complements her DO-IT internship.</p>

<p>When asked about disability in the United States, Yui said that she was inspired by the slogan “Nothing about us without us” from the Independent Living Movement of the early 1970s. She’d like to contribute to positive changes for people with disability in her community in Japan.</p>

<p>As a TOMODACHI trainee, Yui would like to learn how students with disabilities access college in the United States, how they advocate for themselves, and the role that social services and college disability services play in facilitating access and enabling students to be more self-determined and independent.</p>

<p>After completing her TOMODACHI training, Yui plans to apply her knowledge and experiences in her work for the DO-IT Japan Program and the Waseda University office of disability services. Her goal is to improve supports for students with disabilities so that they can go to college and live independently.</p>

<h3>Ms. Toshiko Kudo</h3>

<blockquote><p>I’ve been always interested in experiencing different cultural views related to disability between Japan and other countries. I’d like to develop my leadership skills through this program to empower others with disability in Japan.”</p></blockquote>

<p>space</p>

<blockquote><p>“How have leaders with disability gained awareness and contributed to their community? If there are disability issues, people with disability should be taking a lead.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Toshiko Kudo works part-time at the Tachikawa Independent Living Center (ILC) in Tokyo, Japan. Diagnosed with muscular dystrophy at the age of thirteen, she is a passionate advocate for disability issues.</p>

<p>At the Tachikawa ILC, Toshiko assists individuals with disabilities to lead more independent lives by connecting them with resources, information, and supports. She is also involved in a project to raise disability awareness among school-age children.</p>

<p>Toshiko’s personal experience with disability has informed her work. As a child, she felt embarrassed about her disability, but over the years she has grown to accept and feel comfortable with it. She has used a wheelchair since 2015, and enjoys the mobility it brings her.</p>

<p>Toshiko loves traveling abroad and experiencing different cultures. She is also interested in how disability is viewed in different countries. In July 2015, she participated in the ADA25: a two-week tour sponsored by TOMODACHI. The tour took her to the US,</p>

<p>where she visited Independent Living Centers in Washington DC, New York, and Chicago.</p>

<p>During this trip, Toshiko felt that people in the U.S. respected her as a person, not as a “person with disability.” This experience made her want to find out more about cultural issues related to disability. Toshiko wrote a report about the trip that she presented at the Tashikawa ILC and other disability organizations with the goal of raising disability awareness.</p>

<p>As a TOMODACHI trainee, Toshiko is interested in issues related to physical accessibility, as well as disability perceptions and attitudes. She would like to learn more about disability activism in Boston, including how people with disabilities become activists and leaders and contribute to social change.</p>

<p>After completing her training, Toshiko plans to share what she learned in Boston with her co-workers and the people she supports at the Tachikawa ILC. By applying what she learns, she hopes to empower other people with disability to gain independence.</p>

<h3>Ms. Tomomi Takata</h3>

<blockquote><p>“I had not noticed anything that would make people with disability feel uncomfortable until I got injuries. My disability made me realize many things I didn’t know. I believe that there must be something I can do as a person who has experiences both with and without disability.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Tomomi Takata works full-time at Avinton Japan in Tokyo, a network engineering company. Prior to her employment, Tomomi attended Kapi‘olani Community College in Hawaii, majoring in social studies. She still has the dream of becoming a social worker one day.</p>

<p>As a college student, Tomomi was seriously injured in a bicycle accident. Despite successful surgery, the injury got worse and led to osteonecrosis, a disease that causes bones in the joints to break down. Tomomi had to start using a cane for walking.</p>

<p>After the injury, Tomomi realized that people with and without disabilities live in separate worlds due to a lack of awareness and mutual understanding. She became interested in creating more inclusive communities where people with and without disabilities can live side by side.</p>

<p>As a TOMODACHI trainee, Tomomi wants to learn how technology assists people with disabilities in becoming more independent and moving around more safely. She is also interested in how people can benefit from universal design for physical spaces and for learning. After completing her TOMODACHI training, Tomomi plans to apply her knowledge and experiences in her work to promote universally designed and inclusive environments and spaces that benefit all.</p>
